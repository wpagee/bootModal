Boot Modal
==========

Boot Modal has evoloved from a project I'm working on were we needed our dialogs to handle a number of functions
not currently available with bootstrap modals. 

1. Dynamic Creation of Modals
2. DOM injection and removel of modal objects
3. The ability to have multipule modals open (Automatic handling of focusing the most recent dialog)
4. The ablitity to associate a knockout viewModel with a dialog
5. If knockout is not included we create a simple result object of all the dialogs inputs. 

This project continues to evolve as I attempt to add additional features and improve upon my existing code.
